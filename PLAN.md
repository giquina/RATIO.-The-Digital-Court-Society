### Core Identity
Ratio is ONE thing: A constitutional training ground for UK law students.

### Key Principles
1. One primary action per screen
2. Premium = restraint (no social media noise)
3. Institutional tone (serious, calm, authoritative)
4. Mobile-first ruthlessness (44px tap targets, breathing room)
5. Ship focused, add later (Phase 1 Core → Phase 2 Institutional → Phase 3 Governance → Phase 4 Ecosystem)
