### 1. What is Ratio?

Ratio is a constitutional training ground for UK law students. It brings together AI-powered advocacy practice, live video mooting, legal research tools, competitive tournaments, and governance simulation in a single platform. The goal is to provide structured, repeatable practice for the skills that define legal education: oral advocacy, case analysis, legal reasoning, and professional conduct.

---

### 2. Is Ratio free?

Yes. A free tier is available with core features including 3 AI practice sessions per month, unlimited live moots, access to the legal research engine, and an advocacy portfolio. Premium tiers (£5.99/month and £7.99/month) unlock unlimited AI sessions and advanced tools.

### 3. Who can join?

Ratio is designed for UK law students across all stages of qualification -- LLB, GDL, LPC, BPC, and SQE preparation. 142 UK universities are supported. Planned `.ac.uk` email verification will ensure the platform remains a dedicated space for law students. Registration is currently open to all.

### 4. How does the AI Judge work?

The AI Judge offers four distinct practice modes:

- **The Judge** -- Simulates a High Court judge with formal interventions, procedural challenges, and scored assessments.
- **The Mentor** -- A coaching mode that provides supportive guidance, identifies weaknesses, and suggests improvements.
- **SQE2 Examiner** -- A timed assessment mode aligned with SQE2 oral advocacy requirements, including structured scoring.
- **Opposing Counsel** -- An adversarial mode that challenges your arguments in real time (coming soon).

The AI is powered by Claude (primary) with GPT-4o-mini as a fallback. Performance is scored across 7 advocacy dimensions including legal analysis, case authority, oral presentation, and professional conduct.

### 5. Is the AI accurate?

AI analysis is educational. It is designed to help you practise and improve, not to provide definitive legal answers.

The AI may generate incorrect citations, flawed reasoning, or inaccurate statements of law. Always cross-reference AI output with primary legislation at [legislation.gov.uk](https://www.legislation.gov.uk) and official law reports such as the ICLR series. Do not rely on AI output as legal advice.

### 6. What data do you collect?

Ratio collects the information necessary to operate the platform: email address, university, and profile information you provide during registration and onboarding.

Analytics are powered by Google Analytics 4, subject to cookie consent. No personal data is sold to third parties. For full details, see the Privacy Policy at `/privacy`.

---

### 7. Does it work on mobile?

Yes. Ratio is built with a responsive design that adapts to both desktop and mobile screens. The mobile interface includes a dedicated bottom navigation bar with quick access to Home, Sessions, Law Book, and Community.

---

### 8. Can I use it for exam preparation?

Ratio is designed for advocacy practice and is well suited for SQE2 preparation. It is also useful for practising problem questions, IRAC structuring, case analysis, and oral advocacy skills.

That said, Ratio is a practice tool. It is not a replacement for your university curriculum, textbooks, or the guidance of your tutors.

---

### 9. What is a Chamber?

A Chamber is your team within Ratio. There are four Chambers, named after the Inns of Court: Gray's Inn, Lincoln's Inn, Inner Temple, and Middle Temple.

Chambers compete against each other in national rankings and tournaments. Your chamber is selected during onboarding.

---

### 10. How do citations work?

The Legal Research Engine searches official UK legal sources including statutes and case law. Citations are automatically formatted in OSCOLA (Oxford University Standard for the Citation of Legal Authorities), the standard citation style used in UK legal education.

Always verify citations against the primary source material. Automated citation formatting may contain errors.

---

### 11. Is my content private?

Profile visibility is controlled by you. A public/private toggle allows you to choose whether other Advocates can view your profile and activity.

AI practice sessions are private to your account. Other users cannot view your AI Judge interactions or scores unless you choose to share them.
