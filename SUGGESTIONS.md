# RATIO — Suggestions & Ideas

## Feature Ideas (Deferred)
- Real-time translation for international students (Google Gemini / DeepL API)
- AI-powered A/B test analysis for onboarding experiments
- AI content generation for marketing (social media, blog posts)
- "Login with Ratio" OAuth2 provider for third-party legal tech apps
- University SSO integration (Shibboleth/SAML)
- Third-party app directory for student-built tools
- Discord bot for moot session reminders
- Browser extension for inline case briefs

## UX Improvements
- Consider progressive disclosure for Parliament features (start with Motions only)
- Law Book should feel like reading a calm, authoritative reference — not a wiki
- Explore card hover micro-interactions (subtle gold glow, 1% scale)
- Consider "Quick Practice" 5-minute AI Judge mode for re-engagement

## Architecture Notes
- Consider moving from Zustand to pure Convex state when backend is fully connected
- Evaluate `@next/bundle-analyzer` after Day 14 to identify bundle size issues
- Consider edge functions for AI moderation to reduce latency

## Business & Strategy
- API marketplace with usage-based pricing for universities and law firms
- Ratio portfolio as "GitHub for lawyers" — portfolio link in training contract applications
- Partner with mooting societies at Russell Group universities for early adoption
- Consider white-labelling AI Judge for legal education companies
