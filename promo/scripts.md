# Voiceover Scripts — Rewritten for Natural Human Delivery

Voice direction: Warm, unhurried British male. Think documentary narrator,
not advert. Slight pauses between thoughts. Never sounds like they're
reading. Sounds like they're remembering.

## Video 1: Moot Court Cinematic (75s)

**Scene 1 — Cold Open [0–3s]**
"Every advocate starts somewhere."

**Scene 2 — Preparation [3–11s]**
"Long before the courtroom. Before the wig, the gown, any of it.
There's the work you do when nobody's watching."

**Scene 3 — Choose Judge [11–19s]**
"RATIO pairs you with an AI Judge. Four temperaments — strict, Socratic,
pragmatic, or standard. You pick the bench."

**Scene 4 — Case Brief [19–29s]**
"You get a genuine constitutional law brief. Real authorities, real facts,
and a role — junior counsel, leading counsel, whichever suits you."

**Scene 5 — Court Opens [29–38s]**
"Then the session starts. You argue your case, live, in real time.
The Judge listens. And when you slip — the Judge pushes back."

**Scene 6 — Exchange [38–47s]**
"You distinguish the authorities. You think on your feet.
It feels like standing before a real bench — because the pressure is the same."

**Scene 7 — Feedback [47–54s]**
"When it's over, you get a proper judgment.
Scored across seven dimensions of advocacy."

**Scene 8 — Improvement [54–62s]**
"Detailed written feedback. What worked, what didn't,
and a clear sense of where to go next."

**Scene 9 — CTA [62–75s]**
"RATIO. The Digital Court Society.
It's free for UK law students. You can start today."

The AI Judge speaks aloud using the George voice (authoritative British male).
These play during the chat exchange while the advocate types in text.

**Judge Line 1 [~3.8s]**
"This court is now in session. Counsel, you may proceed with your submissions on the matter of parliamentary sovereignty."

**Judge Line 2 [~7s]**
"Counsel, that is textbook recitation. What is the ratio in Factortame? Apply it to the facts before this court."

**Judge Line 3 [~10s]**
"That is helpful, Counsel. Now — what about the effect of the European Union Withdrawal Act 2018? Does that not undermine your entire position?"
